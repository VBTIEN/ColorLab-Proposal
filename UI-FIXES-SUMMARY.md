## 🔧 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Header Contrast Problem ✅**

**❌ Before:**
- Header had same gradient as background
- Poor text visibility
- Hard to read API status

**✅ After:**
- Changed to dark gradient: `#2c3e50 → #34495e`
- Added text shadows for better readability
- Enhanced API status visibility with better colors
- Added box shadow for depth

**CSS Changes:**
```css
.header {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2c3e50 0%, #34495e 100%);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}

.header h1 {
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

### **2. Choose Image Button Double-Click Issue ✅**

**❌ Before:**
- Button click opened multiple file dialogs
- Clicking upload area also triggered file dialog
- No prevention of duplicate dialogs

**✅ After:**
- Added `isFileDialogOpen` flag to prevent duplicates
- Separated button click from upload area click
- Added proper event handling and prevention
- Reset file input value to allow same file selection

**JavaScript Changes:**
```javascript
let isFileDialogOpen = false;

function openFileDialog() {
    if (isFileDialogOpen) {
        console.log('File dialog already open, ignoring click');
        return;
    }
    
    isFileDialogOpen = true;
    // ... proper dialog handling
}
```
